Team Policies for team "Justice League"

#Team Communication
    1. Our team will be meeting one a week, on a flexible schedule, so as of now we do not have a specific day we meet.
    2. Our team will contact via text or Google Hangout, possibly even email if need be.
    3. Our team sees an adequate level of communication being discussion during class time, as well as texting or emailing when need be.
    4. Our team gets along pretty well, and we're all chill guys so we do not have a need for a "laison" person.

#Participation
    1. Our team assigns issues on a pick-and-choose basis. If a member sees an issue appealing and selects it first then it is assigned to that person.
    2. When a team member finishes their issue, they will create a branch for that issue and then submit a merge request when they believe the issue is complete. 
    3. Our team tracks participation by their input in discussions, finding solutions, as well as completing issues. 
    4. A "general" participation level would be if a member participates regularly in discussion, completes assignments they have chosen, helps out other members when needed, and is an all-around awesome guy.
    5. If a member seems to be having an "inadequate" participation level then we will have a discussion and discuss problems and solutions to those problems.
    6. If a member seems to be doing a majority of the workload, we will discuss with them and figure out a way to pick up the slack in order to give everyone a blanced workload.
    
#Evaluation
    1. Our group plans to either commit professor Berns, or submit a merge request so that he can overlook any code and then comment suggestions, fixes, etc., but ultimately, we will merge the final version and close the issue.
