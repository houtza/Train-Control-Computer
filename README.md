Team Policies for team "Justice League"
# Project Goal

- Develop and implement the code necessary for the successful operation of the Flying Scotsman Model Railroad Control System as defined in the operations manual.
- [Operations Manual](http://www.cs.uni.edu/~adberns/courses/cs4740-f17/user_manual.pdf)

# Team Communication

- Our team will be meeting one a week, on a flexible schedule, so as of now we do not have a specific day we meet.
- Our team will contact via text or Google Hangout, possibly even email if need be.
- Our team sees an adequate level of communication being discussion during class time, as well as texting or emailing when need be.
- Our team gets along pretty well, and we're all chill guys so we do not have a need for a "laison" person.

# Participation

- Our team assigns issues on a pick-and-choose basis. If a member sees an issue appealing and selects it first then it is assigned to that person.
- When a team member finishes their issue, they will create a branch for that issue and then submit a merge request when they believe the issue is complete. 
- Our team tracks participation by their input in discussions, finding solutions, as well as completing issues. 
- A "general" participation level would be if a member participates regularly in discussion, completes assignments they have chosen, helps out other members when needed, and is an all-around awesome guy.
- If a member seems to be having an "inadequate" participation level then we will have a discussion and discuss problems and solutions to those problems.
- If a member seems to be doing a majority of the workload, we will discuss with them and figure out a way to pick up the slack in order to give everyone a blanced workload.
    
# Evaluation

- Our group plans to either commit professor Berns, or submit a merge request so that he can overlook any code and then comment suggestions, fixes, etc., but ultimately, we will merge the final version and close the issue.
